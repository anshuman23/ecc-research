# _An Elliptic Curve Cryptography based Encryption Scheme for securing the Cloud against Eavesdropping Attacks_
Code for the paper of the same name accepted at IEEE CIC 2017

## Dependencies
- [x] **seccure** : run ```pip install seccure``` before running code from this repo.
- [x] **Python 2.7.8**

## How to run
* run the following command in terminal```git clone https://github.com/anshuman23/ecc-research```
* To run the novel ecc based encryption/decryption method proposed in the paper run ```python ecc.py``` 
* Type in your message to be encrypted and you should see it decrypted by the script subsequently
* We have also provided an RSA script for comparison which works much like ```ecc.py``` as shown above. To run, just type ```python rsa.py```
